Photonsters fiber laser logo reveal animation in various formats.

To use the ElfinUI package:
1. Copy all the files to a clean FAT32-formatted SD card
2. Put the SD card in the SD slot on your Elfin Screen
3. Boot the screen.  You will be prompted to update boot_image.jpg
4. Select the checkbox, and click the button in the lower right.
5. Once the progress bar fills and/or the screen reboots, move the SD card to a computer and remove or rename boot_image.jpg in the root folder.
6. Place the SD card back into the screen and boot. It should display the photonsters banner+animation before entering the UI.
7. Note: this zip also contains an ARM version of busybox and a setupbusybox.sh script.  This significantly enhances the shell environment when accessed with ADB tools.
